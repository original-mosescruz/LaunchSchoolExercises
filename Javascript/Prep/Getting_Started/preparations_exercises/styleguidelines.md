Which of the following names don't satisfy the style guidelines for naming variables, functions, or constants?

index
CatName
snake_case
lazyDog
quick_Fox
1stCharacter
operand2
BIG_NUMBER

Unacceptable names: snake_case and quick_Fox contain underscores; underscores are permitted in constant names, 
but these aren't constant names since they use lowercase letters. 1stCharacter isn't valid at all: names may not begin with a digit.
